The C++ IMU-TK Library (Inertial Measurement Units ToolKit) provides simple functions and data structures to calibrate MEMS-based inertial navigation units, and to process and display IMU data. 
IMU-TK implements a multi-position calibration method that does not require any parameter tuning and simply requires the sensor to be moved by hand and placed in a set of different, automatically detected, static positions. IMU-TK also provides a collection of functions for data integration.
